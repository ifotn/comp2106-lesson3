Starting with Node and NPM

In this lesson, we built our first NodeJS application.

We tried the http module and used createServer to start a local web server listening on port 3000 for requests.

We used npm to create a package.json file and also to install nodemon (for auto-restarts) and connect (as an alternative to using the http module).

We examined how connect maps urls to different functions in our server-side javascript.

We also looked at sending response headers (text vs json, 200 vs 404) and how to parse a url's querystring.
